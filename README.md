# TASK4
Sales Prediction Using Python (CodSoft Internship Task)
This task is part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship and focuses on building a sales prediction model using Python and machine learning techniques.

🧠 Objective:
To predict future sales of a product by analyzing various influencing factors such as:

Advertising expenditure (TV, Radio, Newspaper, Online, etc.)

Target audience segmentation

Platform performance

📊 Task Description:
As a Data Science intern, your role is to:

Use Python and machine learning libraries to analyze a given dataset.

Train a model to forecast sales based on input features like ad spending and market factors.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error.

Help businesses optimize marketing strategies and make data-driven decisions by leveraging your prediction model.

🧩 Skills You’ll Practice:
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Data visualization

Linear Regression and/or other ML models

Model evaluation

Real-world business application of ML

📁 Dataset:
You are provided with two datasets (choose any one) through clickable links in the task prompt. Each dataset likely contains:

Advertising spend across platforms

Sales figures

Possibly other business metrics

🚀 End Goal:
Create a predictive model that helps businesses estimate future sales, leading to better budgeting, campaign planning, and sales optimization.

Let me know if you'd like a report format, Jupyter Notebook template, or project explanation for submission.
